I feel <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AoC</a> is a nice way to get to know the language of your choice. There's string manipulation, basic mathematics and more. `bash` isn't the ideal language for this task because (in my opinion) it wasn't meant to solve these kind of problems. Nevertheless, I wanted to expand my experience with `bash` and so I'll attempt to solve all the AoC problems using this language.

I might not be able to solve the problems on the same day (heck, I'm starting almost a week late) and might even skip some problems altogether. I also plan to use common tools like `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, etc and not rely on pure bash.

</ul>

First, let's get the first value and setup variables
```bash
prev_value="$(head -1 $INP_FILE)"
# keep count in this variable
inc_count=0
# store input file in a variable
INP_FILE="../inp/1"
```

Now, skipping the first line, we need to iterate over the rest and count the changes
```bash
sed -n '2,$p' "$INP_FILE" | while read value; do
    (( value > prev_value )) && (( inc_count++ ))
    prev_value=$value
done
```

Finally, lets print the answer
```bash
echo $inc_count
# Output:
0
```

`WRONG ANSWER`. Umm... what?! After opening the file and confirming that the answer indeed isn't 0, I decided to do some print debugging...
```bash
sed -n '2,$p' "$INP_FILE" | while read value; do
    (( value > prev_value )) && (( inc_count++ ))
    echo $inc_count
    prev_value=$value
done
```
...and surely, non zero values were being printed:
```bash
...
1398
1399
1400
1400
```
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/4667509" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This</a> confirmed my doubt that the piped `while` loop was actually running inside a subshell.

A fix, also mentioned in the post was to wrap the `while` loop and `echo` inside braces to make it be processed by the same subshell.
```bash
sed -n '2,$p' "$INP_FILE" | {
    while read value; do
        (( value > prev_value )) && (( inc_count++ ))
        prev_value=$value
    done
    echo $inc_count
}
```

Note that the variable originally declared outside is still 0.

Firstly, I'll make a function, `part1` that solves part 1. It'll accept a single argument: a filename which has the numbers

We're going to use `paste` and <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">process substitution</a> to calculate the window sum.

A little bit of background first: we want to offset the stream of numbers and want to see them side by side, very much like the illustration provided on the website:
```
199  A
200  A B
208  A B C
210    B C D
200  E   C D
207  E F   D
240  E F G
269    F G H
260      G H
263        H
```

Using paste, we can merge two numbers from the lines together:
```bash
paste <(seq 1 5) <(seq 1 5)

# Output:
1	1
2	2
3	3
4	4
5	5
```

We can achieve the offset simply by using `echo`. Also, changing delimiter to +
```bash
paste -d+ <(seq 1 5) <(echo; seq 1 5)

# Output:
1+
2+1
3+2
4+3
5+4
+5
```

Passing this to `bc` will give us the sum for valid windows and print `(standard_in) [NUMBER]: syntax error` to stderr, which will get ignored anyways ;)

Putting it all together:
```bash
tmpfile="$(mktemp)"

# calculate sum of 3-interval window
# NOTE: numbers not part of a window will get ignored anyways
paste -d+ "$INP_FILE" <(echo; cat "$INP_FILE") <(echo; echo; cat "$INP_FILE") | bc > "$tmpfile" 2>/dev/null

part1 "$tmpfile"

rm "$tmpfile"
```
